# Sitrep: the overnight run (2026-10-17 to 18)

What was asked:
- **First,** align wvs with Thistle Tea ([FULL_PARITY_PLAN.md](FULL_PARITY_PLAN.md)), committing and pushing as each
  phase lands. Load tests are capped at five minutes.
- **Then,** the kobold's reach, performance, and robustness ("Elixir's reliability").
- **Last,** a code review.

This file is where the decisions made along the way are written down, so you can override any of them, along with
the questions waiting for you.

## Questions for you

1. **Death's wear, three small differences** (from 2a). Should they be aligned with Thistle Tea? Until you say so,
   they stay documented and unchanged.
   - Spirit of Redemption: wvs wears gear down when the spirit ends. Thistle Tea does at the fatal blow, and only if
     a player didn't strike it.
   - A death by one's own hand: wvs wears gear down, Thistle Tea doesn't.
   - The killing blow: in wvs it can also cost the one-in-200 wear of any blow. In Thistle Tea it can't.

2. **Robustness: what a restarted map does with its players.** Its players are saved and sent to the character
   screen. Should they go straight back into the fresh map instead?
3. **Robustness: should a hung map abort the server,** so systemd or Docker restarts the whole process (OTP's
   top-level "let it crash")? Today the watchdog only logs it, since a hung task can't be killed from inside.
4. **wow_messages' crash bugs.** The robustness work found that wow_messages reserves memory from counts in the
   packet before reading them: a `/who` claiming 4 billion strings asks for 96 GB and aborts the process. It also
   `unwrap`s zlib and underflows sizes in `CMSG_WARDEN_DATA` and `CMSG_BUG`. wvs now guards against all of these
   itself. Should they also be fixed in your fork, or reported to gtker upstream? That would be a public issue,
   which is why I'm asking first.

5. **Knockback on creatures** (from 2b). Should a knockback move a creature, as mangos-classic does and wvs now
   does, or only break its cast, as Thistle Tea does? I kept mangos-classic's.

## Decisions made (override any)

1. **The kobold's reach.** wvs let a unit swing from a yard beyond its melee range. Thistle Tea (`in_melee_range?`)
   and mangos-classic (`CanReachWithMeleeAttack`) allow none. That yard is the "couple of yards too far" you saw: the
   kobold hit you from where your own swing was out of range.
   - **What changed:** the yard is gone. Two units both running (not walking) get mangos-classic's `MELEE_LEEWAY` of
     8/3 yards, as the 1.12 client does.
   - **Where it goes beyond Thistle Tea:** Thistle Tea has no leeway. Without it, a player chasing a running creature
     would get "out of range" from the server where the client lets them swing.
   - **Distance:** stays 3D, as Thistle Tea measures it. mangos measures a creature's reach in 2D.
2. **How the work runs.**
   - **Isolation:** each stage runs in its own git worktree (`~/wvs-wt/<stage>`, branch `parity/<stage>`).
   - **Merging:** I merge each stage into `master` when the full suite and clippy are clean, then push.
   - **Records:** the agents don't edit THISTLE_TEA_DIFFERENCES.md or this file. I do, at each merge, so the branches
     don't conflict.
3. **A whole-repo `cargo fmt`.** The toolchain's rustfmt (1.10) formats 67 files differently from how they were
   committed. That is one mechanical commit (`ec87804`), made before the stages branched, so each agent can run
   `cargo fmt` without churning files it never touched.
4. **The matrix's not-applicable rows.** Phase 1a lists all 8,850 Thistle Tea tests in `docs/parity/matrix.csv`.
   I marked 26 of them not applicable: the web server, telemetry, the developer seed, the namigator NIF, and the
   Elixir layering rules. The rest are being mapped by area.
5. **wow_messages misreads 1.12's stop packets.** A STOP `SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE` ends after its move type in 1.12
   (mangos-classic's `WriteStopMovement`), but the fork read on into spline flags. So wvs's test client and peon
   dropped every creature stop as unparsed; the real client was never affected.
   - **The fix:** fork `e904e8e`, repinned together in rustigator `2eeb576`, wvs `2bed07d` and peon `ca35164`, so
     they share one `wow_world_base`.
   - **Tests that changed with it:** three wvs tests waited for "a move" and had been passing because stops never
     reached them. They now skip stops.
   - **Left as it was:** `SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE_TRANSPORT` has the same problem and is still read the old way. Nothing in
     wvs sends one yet.
   - **Failures it didn't cause:** six `cmsg_update_account_data` tests in the fork fail with "incomplete deflate
     stream". Their code is unchanged by this fix.

6. **2a's choices, as Thistle Tea has them:**
   - Lay on Hands takes only the percentage healing modifiers; it used to take the flat bonus too.
   - Healing Way's gain multiplies the heal with its flat bonus, in Thistle Tea's order.
   - A dispelled passive from gear (a set bonus) comes back at the next gear sync.
   - A dispel now takes passive auras of its type. vmangos's own `EffectDispel` has no passive check either, so the
     old note that "vmangos skips them" was wrong.

7. **Creature size and reach** (found while mapping), aligned with Thistle Tea's mob builder.
   - **The size:** the template's for its display, else the display's own (CreatureDisplayInfo's scale times its
     model's).
   - **Reach and radius:** they grow from the display's own size. Before, they were multiplied by the whole scale,
     so Onyxia reached 47 yards rather than 26.
   - **Where mangos-classic differs:** it would give Onyxia 23.4, the model's reach at her template's own scale. I
     followed Thistle Tea.
   - **What you'll notice:** creatures whose template sets no scale (Hogger, Kobold Miners) now show at their
     display's size, 1.15, instead of 1. The kobold's reach didn't change; your kobold report was the yard of slack
     in decision 1.

8. **Robustness's thresholds**, all in `docs/RELIABILITY.md`:
   - **A creature** is restarted from its spawn at its 2nd panic within 5 minutes, and quarantined at its 4th.
     Quarantine means it lies dead for 10 years; a summon is simply removed.
   - **A player** whose packets panic 10 times in a minute is saved and sent to the character screen.
   - **A map** restarts at 200 update-step panics in a minute. A restart loses what only the map held:
     - the open world's dead respawn;
     - vendor stock refills;
     - battlegrounds, world PvP, the arena and escorts start over.

     Dungeon copies keep their dead.
   - **The packet guards:**
     - an auth session is at most 8 KiB;
     - a declared decompressed size is at most 0xFFFFF;
     - a GM command's coordinates must be finite and within ±100,000.

9. **2b's choices:**
   - **Run mode:** every monster move carries it, walking creatures too. mangos-classic always sets it ("client has
     strange issues without that flag"), and so does Thistle Tea.
   - **Points:** a move's points are offsets from its destination, which the old code got wrong for 1.12.
     Intermediate points within 0.7 yards of the destination are left out, as mangos-classic does.
   - **Flyers' splines** are hand-encoded, in whole points.
   - **Distract** affects creatures only.
   - **Charge:** a rooted player mid-charge gets the root at once; Thistle Tea defers it to arrival.
   - **Pools:** an event change re-picks a pool, removing members that are out even mid-fight, as Thistle Tea does.
   - **Healing on leashing:** a creature heals as it leashes, and only if it regenerates, rather than on getting
     home (M9 and C11).
